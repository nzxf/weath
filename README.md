## FEATURES
- **Auto detect your location and give weather report**: WEATH uses the browser's geolocation feature to automatically detect the user's current location. Once detected, it provides a detailed weather report for that specific area.

- **Show weather forecast for the following 7 days**: In addition to providing real-time data for your area, WEATH also displays a seven-day forecast that shows how the weather is expected to change throughout the week.

- **Sideshow: Give weather reports from a (randomly chosen) city from each continent**: This feature allows users to explore what kind of weather different parts of the world are experiencing. The app randomly selects one city from each continent and displays its current conditions.

- **Images shown based on time of day and the weather condition of the city**: To provide an immersive experience, WEATH incorporates images that match both time-of-day and current atmospheric conditions. For example, if it's sunny outside in your area during daytime hours, you'll see bright blue skies with fluffy white clouds in your app background!

- **User preference: Metric/imperial system measurement and Celsius/Fahrenheit temperature scale**: Users can choose their preferred units for displaying temperature measurements by selecting either metric or imperial systems. Additionally they can switch between Celsius or Fahrenheit temperature scales according to their personal preference.

- **Simple transition/movement**: Finally, WEATH features smooth transitions/animations when switching between screens or updating information within them. These animations make using this application feel intuitive while making sure everything loads quickly!
